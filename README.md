The proposed project activity with title under UCR “2.5 MW Bundled Small Scale Wind Power
Project by M/s Investment & Precision Castings Limited”. in Gujarat is a grid connected renewable 
power generation activity which incorporates installation and operation of Two Wind Turbine
Generator (WTGs) having capacity 2.5 MW manufactured and supplied by Suzlon Energy Ltd. in the
district Jamnagar (Currently Devbhoomi Dwarka) of the state of Gujarat in India. The project is an 
operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal 
Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The project activity aims to harness the kinetic energy of wind (a renewable source) to generate
electricity. The net generated electricity from the project activity is used for captive consumption. A 
wheeling agreement is signed between M/s Investment & Precision Castings Limited and Gujarat 
Energy Transmission Corporation Ltd. (GETCO) i.e., state utility. In the pre-project scenario, the PP 
was importing the required electricity from the state utility i.e., GETCO (is a part of the regional 
grid, earlier known as NEWNE grid) to meet its captive requirement of electrical energy. Currently, 
NEWNE grid is connected to large numbers of fossil fuel-based power plants. Hence, project activity 
is displacing the gross electricity generation i.e., 33,194 MWh from the NEWNE grid, which 
otherwise would have been imported from the NEWNE grid.
______
The project activity involves 2 Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) having total capacity of 2.5 MW 
manufactured and supplied by Suzlon Energy Ltd.
